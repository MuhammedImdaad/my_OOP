# my_OOP
this repository contains my various OOP implementations using C++ language. I made a repository to keep track of what I have done

* casting.cpp - tiny example of static cast
* ruleof3.cpp - standard rule of 3 implementation
* inheritance.cc - solving diamond problem in multiple inheritance
* templateSP.cc - function template, class template, template specialization
* singleton.cc - basic singleton design pattern implementation
* class.cpp - a complete OOP implementation including inheritance, polymorphism and dynamic casting
